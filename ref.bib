abstract = {The importance of size, functional features and morphological features in adaptation for walking in birds were studied. The time and space kinematic parameters of locomotion were compared in two running birds, the ratites (rhea, kiwi, Paleognatiforms), in two swimming birds, (ducks) and two striding birds, (quail and Guinea fowl). The results showed that in the two phases, stance and swing, the time and space parameters worked in opposite ways: the duration of the swing was constant, but its length increased with speed. In contrast, the duration of the stance was correlated to speed, while its length was not (except in ducks). In all the birds, a higher speed was achieved by a decrease of the stance duration, and an increase of the swing length. The kinematic parameters were not used in the same way in all species: There is a size effect and large birds increase their speed mainly by increasing the frequency of their movements and the small species increase mainly their amplitude. Nevertheless, it is not the main factor and morphology, such as swimming adaptation features of the ducks, and behaviour, are important because they modify the mechanical constraints and influence the kinematics parameters. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {Most birds use at least two modes of locomotion: flying and walking (terrestrial locomotion). Whereas the wings and tail are used for flying, the legs are mainly used for walking. The role of other body segments remains, however, poorly understood. In this study, we examine the kinematics of the head, the trunk, and the legs during terrestrial locomotion in the quail (Coturnix coturnix). Despite the trunk representing about 70{\%} of the total body mass, its function in locomotion has received little scientific interest to date. This prompted us to focus on its role in terrestrial locomotion. We used high-speed video fluoroscopic recordings of quails walking at voluntary speeds on a trackway. Dorso-ventral and lateral views of the motion of the skeletal elements were recorded successively and reconstructed in three dimensions using a novel method based on the temporal synchronisation of both views. An analysis of the trajectories of the body parts and their coordination showed that the trunk plays an important role during walking. Moreover, two sub-systems participate in the gait kinematics: (i) the integrated 3D motion of the trunk and thighs allows for the adjustment of the path of the centre of mass; (ii) the motion of distal limbs transforms the alternating forward motion of the feet into a continuous forward motion at the knee and thus assures propulsion. Finally, head bobbing appears qualitatively synchronised to the movements of the trunk. An important role for the thigh muscles in generating the 3D motion of the trunk is suggested by an analysis of the pelvic anatomy. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier GmbH.},

abstract = {High-speed terrestrial locomotion inevitably involves high acceleration and extensive loadings on the legs. This imposes a challenging trade-off between weight and strength in leg design. This paper introduces a new design paradigm for a robotic leg inspired by musculoskeletal structures. The central hypothesis is that employing a tendon-bone co-location architecture not only provides compliance in the leg, but can also reduce bone stresses caused by bending on structures. This hypothesis is applied to a leg design, and verified by simulations and the experiments on a prototype. In addition, we also present an optimization scheme to maximize the strength to weight ratio. Using the tendon-bone co-location architecture, the stress on the bone during a stride is reduced by up to 59{\%}. A new foam-core prototyping technique enables creating structural characteristics similar to mammalian bones in the robotic leg. This method allows us to use lighter polymeric structures that are cheaper and quicker to fabricate than conventional fabrication methods, and can eventually greatly shorten the design iteration cycle time.},

abstract = {Locomotion and movement economy are cornerstone topics in movement science. Modeling the leg as a hybrid mass-spring pendulum shows walking economy should be optimized when stride frequency matches the resonant frequency of the limb. Human walking is described as self-optimizing because mean preferred (PSF) and modeled resonant (RSF) stride frequencies usually are statistically equivalent, but this depiction may not be fully justi ed. Purpose: To more thoroughly examine the self-optimization characterization and the consequences of obligating use of the RSF. Methods: Forty-seven individuals of diverse statures completed 3 consecutive days of preferred walking trials on a treadmill where stride rate, stride length, walking speed, heart rate and walking economy measures were made under steady state heart rate conditions. Anthropometric measures were taken to build a hybrid model of the leg and model the RSF. Reliability across days was evaluated via repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and intra-class correlation ($\alpha$=.05) and correlations were calculated for PSF and RSF. A separate sample of 20 participants walked under 3 conditions, (1) completely preferred; (2) at the original preferred speed using the RSF; and (3) with the option to establish a new preferred speed while using the RSF. Results: Gait characteristics were fundamentally reliable across days and the correlation between PSF and RSF was weak (8{\%} explained variance). Walking economy improved 14{\%} when using the RSF and allowed to self-select the speed / stride length used at that cadence. Conclusions: e results raised slight questions about current self-optimization presumptions and further emphasized the role of resonance in walking economy},

For the realisation of high-speed motions in these conditions under the limitation of control torques, it is necessary to identify at first, through on-line analysis of motions in the process of manipulation, the real parameters of natural modes. Then the control torques should be brought into correlation with natural motions by the adaptation of control in accordance with the findings of identification. As a result, the processes of identification, adaptation and control have to be optimised in accordance with the dynamics of robot oscillation.

abstract = {There is much to gain from providing walking machines with passive dynamics, e.g. by including compliant elements in the structure. These elements can offer interesting properties such as self-stabilization, energy efficiency and simplified control. However, there is still no general design strategy for such robots and their controllers. In particular, the calibration of control parameters is often complicated because of the highly nonlinear behavior of the interactions between passive components and the environment. In this article, we propose an approach in which the calibration of a key parameter of a walking controller, namely its intrinsic frequency, is done automatically. The approach uses adaptive frequency oscillators to automatically tune the intrinsic frequency of the oscillators to the resonant frequency of a compliant quadruped robot. The tuning goes beyond simple synchronization and the learned frequency stays in the controller when the robot is put to halt. The controller is model free, robust and simple. Results are presented illustrating how the controller can robustly tune itself to the robot, as well as readapt when the mass of the robot is changed. We also provide an analysis of the convergence of the frequency adaptation for a linearized plant, and show how that analysis is useful for determining which type of sensory feedback must be used for stable convergence. This approach is expected to explain some aspects of developmental processes in biological and artificial adaptive systems that "develop" through the embodied system-environment interactions},

abstract = {Legged robots can provide access to hazardous environments such as waste sites, disaster areas and even the surfaces of other planets, where large obstacles and uneven terrain impede mobility with traditional wheeled systems. Looking to nature for design inspira- tion, a family of hexapedal robots has been developed that rely on passive mechanical properties and a simple open-loop motor control program to achieve fast and robust per- formance that begins to compare to that seen in nature. These robots are capable of run- ning at over 4 body-lengths/second and can overcome hip-height obstacles without significantly slowing down. Although this approach works well for a range of open-loop parameters, the question of how to "tune" the system to achieve maximum performance while maintaining stability, especially as conditions change, arises. This thesis analyzes the trade-offs in stability and performance for open-loop running systems like the robots starting with simplified one and two degree-of-freedom dynamic models. Analyses of these models are then validated with experimental data of the running hexapods. Results reveal conditions for optimal performance and demonstrate inherent limitations in the use of open-loop control in running. Based on these findings, strategies for adaptation, or self- tuning, of the open-loop motor program are proposed that require only simple, low-band- width sensory feedback. One of these strategies is demonstrated experimentally in the adaptation of stride period in a hexapedal running robot.},

The efficacy of the method is first studied in case of a single-degree-of-freedom linear mechanical oscillator and then extended to an essentially nonlinear micromechanical resonator. Analytical and numerical investigations reveal that the stiffness-switching method can be effectively utilized for generating and controlling self-excited oscillations in simple mechanical structures. However, the amplitude of oscillation obtained by the basic method involving only the stiffness reduction mechanism is found to be extremely sensitive to the uncertainties in the inherent damping of the structure. An alternative switching scheme is also proposed to alleviate this shortcoming. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We discuss the dynamics and stability of a rigid rimless spoked wheel, or regular polygon with an axisymmetric mass distribution, confined to rolling in a vertical plane up or down a slope. By rolling, we mean motions in which the wheel hinges on one support spoke until another spoke collides with the ground, followed by transfer of support to that spoke, and so on. Motions are smooth and energy conserving except at instants of spoke collision. It is the simplest of the passive- dynamic mechanical analogues to two-legged walking; it has neither actuation nor control yet exhibits asymptotically stable periodic motions. We derive a return map for the full nonlinear system and find it has two coexisting fixed points corresponding to (1) standing still on two spokes and (2) limit cycle motion. The fixed points are asymptotically stable for all parameters. The fixed points existence depends on slope angle; for very small slope angles only standing still exists, for intermediate angles both fixed points exist, and for large angles, only limit cycles exist. For intermediate slope angles, we find the basins of attraction for each fixed point. In the limit as the number of spokes goes to infinity, we show that the behavior of the rimless wheel approaches that of a disk rolling without slip or dissipation on a flat surface. This work is a prequel to M. J. Coleman, A. Chatterjee, and A. Ruina, Dynamics and Stability of Systems, 12(3), (Sept., 1997) in which the authors show that the rimless wheels 2D limit cycle has 3D asymptotic stability as well.},

abstract = {Legged animals routinely negotiate rough, unpredictable terrain with agility and stability that outmatches any human-built machine. Yet, we know surprisingly little about how animals accomplish this. Current knowledge is largely limited to studies of steady movement. These studies have revealed fundamental mechanisms used by terrestrial animals for steady locomotion. However, it is unclear whether these models provide an appropriate framework for the neuromuscular and mechanical strategies used to achieve dynamic stability over rough terrain. Perturbation experiments shed light on this issue, revealing the interplay between mechanics and neuromuscular control. We measured limb mechanics of helmeted guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) running over an unexpected drop in terrain, comparing their response to predictions of the mass-spring running model. Adjustment of limb contact angle explains 80{\%} of the variation in stance-phase limb loading following the perturbation. Surprisingly, although limb stiffness varies dramatically, it does not influence the response. This result agrees with a mass-spring model, although it differs from previous findings on humans running over surfaces of varying compliance. However, guinea fowl sometimes deviate from mass-spring dynamics through posture-dependent work performance of the limb, leading to substantial energy absorption following the perturbation. This posture-dependent actuation allows the animal to absorb energy and maintain desired velocity on a sudden substrate drop. Thus, posture-dependent work performance of the limb provides inherent velocity control over rough terrain. These findings highlight how simple mechanical models extend to unsteady conditions, providing fundamental insights into neuromuscular control of movement and the design of dynamically stable legged robots and prosthetic devices.},

@article{Daley2007,
abstract = {We currently know little about how animals achieve dynamic stability when running over uneven and unpredictable terrain, often characteristic of their natural environment. Here we investigate how limb and joint mechanics of an avian biped, the helmeted guinea fowl Numida meleagris, respond to an unexpected drop in terrain during running. In particular, we address how joint mechanics are coordinated to achieve whole limb dynamics. Based on muscle-tendon architecture and previous studies of steady and incline locomotion, we hypothesize a proximo-distal gradient in joint neuromechanical control. In this motor control strategy, (1) proximal muscles at the hip and knee joints are controlled primarily in a feedforward manner and exhibit load-insensitive mechanical performance, and (2) distal muscles at the ankle and tarsometatarso-phalangeal (TMP) joints are highly load-sensitive, due to intrinsic mechanical effects and rapid, higher gain proprioceptive feedback. Limb kinematics and kinetics during the unexpected perturbation reveal that limb retraction, controlled largely by the hip, remains similar to level running throughout the perturbed step, despite altered limb loading. Individual joints produce or absorb energy during both level and perturbed running steps, such that the net limb work depends on the balance of energy among the joints. The hip maintains the same mechanical role regardless of limb loading, whereas the ankle and TMP switch between spring-like or damping function depending on limb posture at ground contact. Initial knee angle sets limb posture and alters the balance of work among the joints, although the knee contributes little work itself. This distribution of joint function results in posture-dependent changes in work performance of the limb, which allow guinea fowl to rapidly produce or absorb energy in response to the perturbation. The results support the hypothesis that a proximo-distal gradient exists in limb neuromuscular performance and motor control. This control strategy allows limb cycling to remain constant, whereas limb posture, loading and energy performance are interdependent. We propose that this control strategy provides simple, rapid mechanisms for managing energy and controlling velocity when running over rough terrain.},

abstract = {Blood to the pelvic limb of the ostrich is provided by the external iliac and ischiatic arteries that arise from the descending aorta. The external iliac artery (a.) gave rise to the pubic a. that supplied the obturator muscles and continued as the femoral a. The femoral a. gave off three branches: (1) cranial coxal a. to muscles above the pre-acetabular ilium; (2) cranial femoral a. to muscles cranial to the femur, the gastrocnemius muscle, hip and stifle joints and (3) medial femoral a. to muscles caudal and medial to the femur. The ischiatic a. gave rise to the caudal coxal a. that supplied muscles caudal to the femur, muscular branches to the iliotibialis lateralis muscle and to the deep femoral a. that supplied the iliofibularis muscle, cutanea femoralis caudalis and lateralis aa., and branches to the flexors of the leg and knee joint, then terminated as the sural and popliteal arteries. The sural a. supplied most of the flexors of the foot. The popliteal a. supplied the knee joint and flexors of the leg, and then terminated as the cranial and caudal tibial arteries. The caudal tibial a. supplied flexors of the foot. The cranial tibial a. provided four branches to the knee and ankle joints and to the leg. The cranial tibial a. continued into the foot as the common dorsal metatarsal a., which gave off seven different branches to the ankle and foot. With few exceptions, the arteries of the ostrich pelvic limb are similar to those of domestic fowl.},

abstract = {When humans and other mammals run, the body's complex system of muscle, tendon and ligament springs behaves like a single linear spring ('leg spring'). A simple spring-mass model, consisting of a single linear leg spring and a mass equivalent to the animal's mass, has been shown to describe the mechanics of running remarkably well. Force platform measurements from running animals, including humans, have shown that the stiffness of the leg spring remains nearly the same at all speeds and that the spring-mass system is adjusted for higher speeds by increasing the angle swept by the leg spring. The goal of the present study is to determine the relative importance of changes to the leg spring stiffness and the angle swept by the leg spring when humans alter their stride frequency at a given running speed. Human subjects ran on treadmill-mounted force platform at 2.5 m s-1while using a range of stride frequencies from 26{\%} below to 36{\%} above the preferred stride frequency. Force platform measurements revealed that the stiffness of the leg spring increased by 2.3-fold from 7.0 to 16.3 kN m-1between the lowest and highest stride frequencies. The angle swept by the leg spring decreased at higher stride frequencies, partially offsetting the effect of the increased leg spring stiffness on the mechanical behavior of the spring-mass system. We conclude that the most important adjustment to the body's spring system to accommodate higher stride frequencies is that leg spring becomes stiffer.},

The ostrich lacks those muscles to the first and second toes (with exception of the M. flexor hallucis longus), which can be found in birds with four toes. The Mm. iliotrochantericus medius, plantaris, extensor proprius digiti IV and adductor digiti IV, which are present in other birds, are also absent, whereas the Mm. pectineus and femorotibialis accessorius additionally occur in the ostrich. The Pars supramedialis is a tendineous part of the M. gastrocnemius, on which the Mm. flexor cruris lateralis and flexor cruris medialis insert by means of a fascial sheet. The caudal part of the M. iliofibularis terminates within the caudal aspect of the superficial fascia cruris. The caudal heads of the Mm. flexor perforatus digiti III and flexor perforatus digiti IV as well as the M. flexor hallucis longus have a common origin on the Fossa poplitea of the femur. The lateral head of the M. flexor perforatus digiti IV and the femoral head of the M. flexor perforans et perforatus digiti III originate on the tendon of origin of the Caput laterale of the M. flexor perforatus digiti III. Furthermore, the last named tendon fuses with the tendon of insertion of the M. ambiens.

abstract = {Seven species of ground-dwelling birds (body mass range: 0.045-90 kg) were filmed while walking and running on a treadmill. High-speed light films were also taken of humans to compare kinematic patterns of avian with human bipedalism. Consistent patterns of stride frequency, stride length, step length, duty factor and limb excursion were observed in all species, with most of the variation among species being due to differences in body size. In general, smaller bipeds have higher stride frequencies (alpha-M-0.18), shorter stride lengths (alpha-M0.38) and more limited ranges of speed within each gait than large bipeds. After normalizing for size (based on Froude number, after Alexander, 1977), remaining kinematic variation is largely due to interspecific differences in posture and relative limb segment lengths. For their size, smaller bipeds have greater step lengths, limb excursion angles and duty factors than large bipeds because of their more crouched posture and greater effective limb length. The most notable differences in limb kinematics between birds and humans occur at the walk-run transition and are maintained as running speed increases. Change of gait is smooth and difficult to discern in birds, but distinct in humans, involving abrupt decreases in step length and duty factor (time of contact) and a corresponding increase in limb swing time. These differences appear to reflect a spring-like run that is stiff in humans (favouring elastic energy recovery) but more compliant in birds (increasing time of ground contact). Differences between birds and humans in balance of the body's centre of mass not only affect femoral orientation and motion, but also affect pattern of limb excursion with speed.},

abstract = {During half-bound gait on a treadmill pikas (Ochotona rufescens: Lagomorpha) show a preference in the choice of the trailing limb ("handedness"). Duration of steps shows significantly higher variation in the trailing limb than in the leading limb. This observation motivated calculations of the position of the center of mass (CoM) in the body frame of the pika during half-bound cycles. CoM is aligned with first of the ulna of the trailing and second of the leading limb during major parts of the forelimbs' stance phase. Referring to our large cineradiographic data base on the kinematics of the legs we could note that the horizontal motion of the CoM in the body is mainly determined by flexion and extension of the back. This observation underlines the determinant role of the trunk as the main engine for fast locomotion. Using high-speed video films we measured the angle of attack (defined as the angle between the ulna and the ground at touch down). We couldn't observe any significant change with speed during half-bound, indicating the important role of self-stabilising mechanisms on the choice of kinematics.},

abstract = {Preferred stride frequency (PSF) of human walking has been shown to be predictable as the resonant frequency of a force-drive harmonic oscillator (FDHO). The purpose of this study was to determine whether walking at the PSF and FDHO leads to minimal metabolic and mechanical costs. Subjects walked on a level treadmill at the PSF, FDHO, and frequencies above and below. Effects of stride length (SL) and speed (S) were assessed by two conditions, one in which SL was constant and the other in which S was constant. The predictability of PSF from resonance was replicated. Walking at the PSF and FDHO frequencies resulted in metabolic costs which were not significantly different (P greater than 0.05). A U-shaped oxygen consumption curve was observed with the minimum at the PSF and FDHO conditions when S was constant. A two-component curve in which a breakpoint was observed was found in the SL constant condition. A significant increase in metabolic cost was observed above the PSF/FDHO (P less than 0.01). Internal work (power) values were not significantly different between walking frequencies for the S constant condition. In the SL constant condition, internal work values showed linear increases as frequency increased. It was concluded that PSF of walking arises from the interface of the resonance properties of the limbs as oscillators and the tendency of biological systems to self-optimize.},

Ground reaction forces and three-dimensional kinematics of the body and leg joints were simultaneously recorded, allowing calculation of joint angles and quasi-static net joint torques. Sidesteps, where the leg on the outside of the turn changes the movement direction, and crossovers using the inside leg, occurred with nearly equal frequency. Ostriches executed maneuvers using a simple control strategy that required minimal changes to leg kinematics or net torque production at individual joints. Although ostriches did use acceleration or braking forces to control body rotation, their morphology allowed for both crossovers and sidesteps to be accomplished with minimal net acceleratory/braking force production. Moreover, body roll and ab/adduction of the leg shifted the foot position away from the turn direction, reducing the acceleratory/braking forces required to prevent under- or over-rotation and aligning the leg with the ground reaction force.},

abstract = {Ballistic walking requires an appropriate configuration of posture and velocity at toe-off to avoid backward falling. In this study, we investigated a determinant of the state of the body center of mass (COM) at the toe-off with regard to ballistic walking. We used an inverted pendulum model to represent ballistic trajectories and the necessary condition for forward progression by a simple relationship between the COM states (position and velocity) at toe-off. This condition was validated through a computer simulation of a 7-link musculoskeletal model and measurement experiments of human movements involving stepping and walking. The results of the model simulation were in good agreement with some of the results predicted by the inverted pendulum model. The measurement experiments of walking and stepping movements showed that most COM states at toe-off satisfied the condition for forward progression and the measured trajectories during single support phase were similar to the ballistic trajectories although humans are capable of walking in non-ballistic ways. These results suggested that the necessary condition for forward progression can predict the COM states at toe-off for efficient movement and for avoiding backward falling during single support phase. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Non-linear leg springs have the potential to improve the performance of running robots and models, but it is not clear to what extent. In this paper, the effect of non-linear leg springs on disturbance rejection behavior is investigated. The optimal leg stiffness profile is determined by optimizing the gait sensitivity norm, a measure for disturbance rejection. The results of this optimization show that the optimal leg stiffness profile is strongly non-linear, and that the disturbance rejection is a factor of seven better than it would be with the optimal linear leg stiffness. The cause for this great improvement is that non-linear leg springs allow stable limit cycles that are much further away from the fall modes.},

It is able to walk with its knees stretched using the redundancy of the legs and to move around an object using a hip-bending motion without touching the object. A knee-stretched locomotion pattern generation is also proposed in this paper, which separately creates joint angles in a supporting and a swinging phase. During knee-stretched walking, the joint rate of the knee will approach infinitely when the knee is stretched. This singularity problem is solved by using the motion of the waist, not the posture of the trunk. The effectiveness of the mechanisms and pattern generations of WABIAN-2LL is verified through dynamic walking experiments.},

Utility for small robots often reflects the exact same problem domain as small animals, hence providing numerous avenues for biological inspiration. This paper begins to investigate the various modes of locomotion adopted by different genus groups in multiple media as an initial attempt to determine the compromise in ability adopted by the animals when achieving multi-modal locomotion. A review of current biologically inspired multi-modal robots is also presented. The primary aim of this research is to lay the foundation for a generation of vehicles capable of multi-modal locomotion, allowing ambulatory abilities in more than one media, surpassing current capabilities. By identifying and understanding when natural systems use specific locomotion mechanisms, when they opt for disparate mechanisms for each mode of locomotion rather than using a synergized singular mechanism, and how this affects their capability in each medium, similar combinations can be used as inspiration for future multi-modal biologically inspired robotic platforms.},

abstract = {Habitual bipedalism is considered as a major breakthrough in human evolution and is the defining feature of hominins. Upright posture is presumably less stable than quadrupedal posture, but when using external support, for example, toddlers assisted by their parents, postural stability becomes less critical. In this study, we show that humans seem to mimic such external support by creating a virtual pivot point (VPP) above their centre of mass. A highly reduced conceptual walking model based on this assumption reveals that such virtual support is sufficient for achieving and maintaining postural stability. The VPP is experimentally observed in walking humans and dogs and in running chickens, suggesting that it might be a convenient emergent behaviour of gait mechanics and not an intentional locomotion behaviour. Hence, it is likely that even the first hominis may have already applied the VPP, a mechanism that would have facilitated the development of habitual bipedalism.},

Parameters leading to chaotic motion have been found and Nonlinear Normal Modes, which may appear nearby the chaotic response have been presented as well. The considered two degree of freedom example shows that the autonomous system (without time dependent excitation) may transit to chaotic vibrations if the system posseses a potential function with "potential wells".

The concept of open-loop control implies that all actuators of a robot receive purely periodic pre-calculated torque or force inputs that are never altered by any feedback interference. Passive-dynamic robots can be considered as a special case with zero actuation for which a stabilization is much easier due to the possibility of time shifts. We have developed a numerical method that optimizes the open-loop stability of solutions of periodic optimal control problems with discontinuities.

Passive dynamic walking (PDW), which has its roots in the pioneering research of McGeer, intrinsically offers not only nonlinear phenomena such as the pull-in effect and period-doubling bifurcation, but also offers an extremely interesting phenomenon that facilitates the engineering of a highly efficient walking robot. In recent years, a wide variety of verification experiments in PDW were performed using actual devices. In contrast, however, very few studies addressed PDR. In the present study, we developed a two-dimensional real physical passive dynamic running biped with knees. The device stands 400 mm tall and weights 4.8 kg. By carefully designing the properties of the elastic elements implemented into the hip joints and the stance legs in the present device, we achieved stable passive dynamic running of 36 steps. The device runs at about 0.83 m/s down a 0.22 rad slope. To the best of our knowledge, this is a first report of such a performance. This result is expected to prove useful not only for designing human-like natural and efficient bipedal robots, but also for understanding the principles underlying bipedal locomotion.},

abstract = {Walking dynamics has been often represented by the controlled falling of an inverted pendulum until the recent study showed that the trajectory of the body center of mass (CoM) and the corresponding ground reaction forces (GRFs) during walking were better represented by a spring loaded inverted pendulum model [1], which has been exclusively used for describing running dynamics. As a model parameter of the mass-spring system, the stiffness of a compliant walking model determines the gait dynamics, such as the gait cycle period and the amplitude ratio of CoM oscillations to an external force, etc.. Therefore examining the change of leg stiffness with various walking conditions would provide the perspectives of mechanical system characteristics of the corresponding gait dynamics. We estimated the effective leg stiffness by tuning a model of compliant legged bipedal walking to match human GRFs at different walking speeds [2], at different age groups [3], and at different loading conditions [4]. Leg stiffness increased with speed and the damping ratio was low and increased slightly with speed in both age groups. The duration of the single support phase showed high correlation with the oscillation period of the complaint walking model. The results also showed that the leg stiffness increased with increasing loads such that the oscillation frequency of the CoM was maintained for a given gait speed. The theoretical leg stiffness that maximizes the elastic energy stored in the compliant leg to propel the CoM during the step transition was well approximated by the empirically estimated leg stiffness. The results imply that the CoM oscillations during a gait cycle may take advantage of resonance characteristics of the spring-like leg and that an increase in leg stiffness with speed and load would beneficially increase the propulsion energy and achieve resonant gait dynamics.},

abstract = {Dynamic forces induced by humans walking change simultaneously in time and space, being random in nature and varying considerably not only between different people but also for a single individual who cannot repeat two identical steps. Since these important aspects of walking forces have not been adequately researched in the past, the corresponding lack of knowledge has reflected badly on the quality of their mathematical models used in vibration assessments of pedestrian structures such as footbridges, staircases and floors. To develop better force models which can be used with more confidence in the structural design, an adequate experimental and analytical approach must be taken to account for their complexity. This paper is the most comprehensive review published to date, of 270 references dealing with different experimental and analytical characterizations of human walking loading. The source of dynamic human-induced forces is in fact in the body motion. To date, human motion has attracted a lot of interest in many scientific branches, particularly in medical and sports science, bioengineering, robotics, and space flight programs. Other fields include biologists of various kinds, physiologists, anthropologists, computer scientists (graphics and animation), human factors and ergonomists, etc. It resulted in technologically advanced tools that can help understanding the human movement in more detail. Therefore, in addition to traditional direct force measurements utilizing a force plate and an instrumented treadmill, this review also introduces methods for indirect measurement of time-varying records of walking forces via combination of visual motion tracking (imaging) data and known body mass distribution. The review is therefore an interdisciplinary article that bridges the gaps between biomechanics of human gait and civil engineering dynamics. Finally, the key reason for undertaking this review is the fact that human-structure dynamic interaction and pedestrian synchronization when walking on more or less perceptibly moving structures are increasingly giving serious cause for concern in vibration serviceability design. There is a considerable uncertainty about how excessive structural vibrations modify walking and hence affect pedestrian-induced forces, significantly in many cases. Modelling of this delicate mechanism is one of the challenges that the international civil structural engineering community face nowadays and this review thus provides a step toward understanding better the problem. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The spring-loaded inverted pendulum describes the planar center-of-mass dynamics of legged locomotion. This model features linear springs with constant parameters as legs. In biological systems, however, spring-like properties of limbs can change over time. Therefore, in this study, it is asked how variation of spring parameters during ground contact would affect the dynamics of the spring-mass model. Neglecting damping initially, it is found that decreasing stiffness and increasing rest length of the leg during a stance phase are required for orbitally stable hopping. With damping, stable hopping is found for a larger region of rest-length rates and stiffness rates. Here, also increasing stiffness and decreasing rest length can result in stable hopping. Within the predicted range of leg parameter variations for stable hopping, there is no need for precise parameter tuning. Since hopping gaits form a subset of the running gaits (with vanishing horizontal velocity), these results may help to improve leg design in robots and prostheses.},

It is possible to construct a running robot that is inherently stable and needs no sensing to reject minor perturbations; the robot is therefore self-stabilizing. In contrast, most previous attempts to make robots run have used active, high bandwidth feedback control systems. I mathematically analyze the behavior of a simple self-stabilizing monopod, determine a running pattern, and generalize the motion to two and four legs. Using physics-based simulations, I demonstrate the stability of these motions as applied to robots. The quadruped can stably trot, pace, bound, and gallop. I verify the simulations' behavior with a physical monopod robot. Low bandwidth control systems layered on top of the self-stabilizing running motion could allow the robot to respond to the operator's desires or changes in the environment.

abstract = {Compared with quadrupeds, bipedal runners of the same weight have longer legs, take longer steps and can presumably use slower, more economical muscle fibers. One might predict that bipedal running is less expensive, but it is not. We hypothesized that bipeds recruit a larger volume of muscle to support their weight, eliminating the potential economy of longer legs and slower steps. To test our hypothesis, we calculated the relative volume of muscle needed to support body weight over a stride in small dogs (Canis familiaris) and wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo) of the same weight. First, we confirmed that turkeys and dogs use approximately the same amount of energy to run at the same speed, and found that turkeys take 1. 8-fold longer steps. Higher muscle forces and/or longer muscle fibers would require a greater volume of active muscle, since muscle volume is proportional to the product of force and fascicle length. We measured both mean fascicle length and mean mechanical advantage for limb extensor muscles. Turkeys generated approximately the same total muscle force to support their weight during running and used muscle fascicles that are on average 2.1 times as long as in dogs, thus requiring a 2.5-fold greater active muscle volume. The greater volume appears to offset the economy of slower rates of force generation, supporting our hypothesis and providing a simple explanation for why it costs the same to run on two and four legs.},

abstract = {Similarly sized bipeds and quadrupeds use nearly the same amount of metabolic energy to run, despite dramatic differences in morphology and running mechanics. It has been shown that the rate of metabolic energy use in quadrupedal runners and bipedal hoppers can be predicted from just body weight and the time available to generate force as indicated by the duration of foot-ground contact, We tested whether this link between running mechanics and energetics also applies to running bipeds. We measured rates of energy consumption and times of foot contact for humans (mean body mass 78.88 kg) and five species of birds (mean body mass range 0.13-40.1 kg). We find that most (70-90 {\%}) of the increase in metabolic rate with speed in running bipeds can be explained by changes in the time available to generate force, The rate of force generation also explains differences in metabolic rate over the size range of birds measured. However, for a given rate of force generation, birds use on average 1.7 times more metabolic energy than quadrupeds. The rate of energy consumption for a given rate of force generation for humans is intermediate between that of birds and quadrupeds. These results support the idea that the cost of muscular force production determines the energy cost of running and suggest that bipedal runners use more energy for a given rate of force production because they require a greater volume of muscle to support their body weight.},

abstract = {Although locomotor kinematics in walking and running birds have been examined in studies exploring many biological aspects of bipedalism, these studies have been largely limited to two-dimensional analyses. Incorporating a five-segment, 17 degree-of-freedom (d.f.) kinematic model of the ostrich hind limb developed from anatomical specimens, we quantified the three-dimensional (3-D) joint axis alignment and joint kinematics during running (at approximately 3.3 m s(-1)) in the largest avian biped, the ostrich. Our analysis revealed that the majority of the segment motion during running in the ostrich occurs in flexion/extension. Importantly, however, the alignment of the average flexion/extension helical axes of the knee and ankle are rotated externally to the direction of travel (37 degrees and 21 degrees , respectively) so that pure flexion and extension at the knee will act to adduct and adbuct the tibiotarsus relative to the plane of movement, and pure flexion and extension at the ankle will act to abduct and adduct the tarsometatarsus relative to the plane of movement. This feature of the limb anatomy appears to provide the major lateral (non-sagittal) displacement of the lower limb necessary for steering the swinging limb clear of the stance limb and replaces what would otherwise require greater adduction/abduction and/or internal/external rotation, allowing for less complex joints, musculoskeletal geometry and neuromuscular control. Significant rotation about the joints' non-flexion/extension axes nevertheless occurs over the running stride. In particular, hip abduction and knee internal/external and varus/valgus motion may further facilitate limb clearance during the swing phase, and substantial non-flexion/extension movement at the knee is also observed during stance. Measurement of 3-D segment and joint motion in birds will be aided by the use of functionally determined axes of rotation rather than assumed axes, proving important when interpreting the biomechanics and motor control of avian bipedalism.},

abstract = {It has been argued that minimization of metabolic-energy costs is a primary determinant of gait selection in terrestrial animals. This view is based predominantly on data from humans and horses, which have been shown to choose the most economical gait (walking, running, galloping) for any given speed. It is not certain whether a minimization of metabolic costs is associated with the selection of other prevalent forms of terrestrial gaits, such as grounded running (a widespread gait in birds). Using biomechanical and metabolic measurements of four ostriches moving on a treadmill over a range of speeds from 0.8 to 6.7 m s(-1), we reveal here that the selection of walking or grounded running at intermediate speeds also favours a reduction in the metabolic cost of locomotion. This gait transition is characterized by a shift in locomotor kinetics from an inverted-pendulum gait to a bouncing gait that lacks an aerial phase. By contrast, when the ostrich adopts an aerial-running gait at faster speeds, there are no abrupt transitions in mechanical parameters or in the metabolic cost of locomotion. These data suggest a continuum between grounded and aerial running, indicating that they belong to the same locomotor paradigm.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the mechanical adaptations linked to economical locomotion in cursorial bipeds. We addressed this question by comparing mass-matched humans and avian bipeds (ostriches), which exhibit marked differences in limb structure and running economy. We hypothesized that the nearly 50 per cent lower energy cost of running in ostriches is a result of: (i) lower limb-swing mechanical power, (ii) greater stance-phase storage and release of elastic energy, and (iii) lower total muscle power output. To test these hypotheses, we used three-dimensional joint mechanical measurements and a simple model to estimate the elastic and muscle contributions to joint work and power. Contradictory to our first hypothesis, we found that ostriches and humans generate the same amounts of mechanical power to swing the limbs at a similar self-selected running speed, indicating that limb swing probably does not contribute to the difference in energy cost of running between these species. In contrast, we estimated that ostriches generate 120 per cent more stance-phase mechanical joint power via release of elastic energy compared with humans. This elastic mechanical power occurs nearly exclusively at the tarsometatarso-phalangeal joint, demonstrating a shift of mechanical power generation to distal joints compared with humans. We also estimated that positive muscle fibre power is 35 per cent lower in ostriches compared with humans, and is accounted for primarily by higher capacity for storage and release of elastic energy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed much larger frontal and internal/external rotation joint loads during ostrich running than in humans. Together, these findings support the hypothesis that a primary limb structure specialization linked to economical running in cursorial species is an elevated storage and release of elastic energy in tendon. In the ostrich, energy-saving specializations may also include passive frontal and internal/external rotation load-bearing mechanisms.},

abstract = {In human and animal running spring-like leg behavior is found. In a spring-mass model, running proves to be self-stable in terms of external perturbations or variations in leg properties (e.g. landing angle). How- ever, biological limbs are not made of springs but, rather, consist of seg- ments where spring-like behavior can be localized at joint level. Here, we use a two-segment leg model to investigate the effects of leg compliance originating from joint level on running stability. Due to leg geometry a nonlinear relationship between leg force and leg compression is found. In contrast to the linear leg spring, the segmented leg is capable of reducing the minimum speed for self-stable running from 3.5 m/s in the spring-mass model to 1.5 m/s for almost straight joint configurations which is below the preferred transition speed from human walking to running (≈ 2 m/s). At moderate speeds the tolerated range of landing angle is largely increased (17 degrees at 5 m/s) compared to the linear leg spring model (2 degrees). However, for fast running an increase of joint stiffness is required to compensate the mechanical disadvantage of larger leg compression. This could be achieved by nonlinear springs enhancing joint stiffness in fast running.},

abstract = {The ostrich is highly specialized in terrestrial locomotion and is the only extant bird that is both didactyl and exhibits a permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint. This extreme degree of digitigrady provides an excellent opportunity for the study of phalangeal adaptation towards fast, sustained bipedal locomotion. Data were gathered in a semi-natural setting with hand-raised, cooperative specimens. Dynamic pressure distribution, centre of pressure (CoP) trajectory and the positional inter-relationship of the toes during stance phase were investigated using pedobarography. Walking and running trials shared a J-shaped CoP trajectory with greater localization of CoP origin as speed increased. Slight variations of 4th toe position in walking affect CoP origin and modulation of 4th toe pressure on the substrate allows correction of balance, primarily at the beginning of stance phase at lower speeds. Load distribution patterns differed significantly between slow and fast trials. In walking, the 3rd and particularly the 4th toe exhibited notable variation in load distribution with minor claw participation only at push-off. Running trials yielded a distinctly triangular load distribution pattern defined by the 4th toe tip, the proximal part of the 3rd toe and the claw tip, with the sharp point of the claw providing an essential traction element at push-off. Consistency of CoP trajectory and load distribution at higher speeds arises from dynamic stability effects and may also reflect stringent limitations to degrees of freedom in hindlimb joint articulation that contribute to locomotor efficiency. This novel research could aid in the reconstruction of theropod locomotor modes and offers a systemic approach for future avian pedobarographic investigations.},

abstract = {The ostrich (Struthio camelus) is the largest extant biped. Being flightless, it exhibits advanced cursorial abilities primarily evident in its characteristic speed and endurance. In addition to the active musculoskeletal complex, its powerful pelvic limbs incorporate passive structures wherein ligaments interact with joint surfaces, cartilage and other connective tissue in their course of motion. This arrangement may enable energy conservation by providing joint stabilisation, optimised limb segment orientation and automated positioning of ground contact elements independently of direct muscle control. The intertarsal joint is of particular interest considering its position near the mid-point of the extended limb and its exposure to high load during stance with significant inertial forces during swing phase. Functional-anatomical analysis of the dissected isolated joint describes the interaction of ligaments with intertarsal joint contours through the full motion cycle. Manual manipulation identified a passive engage-disengage mechanism (EDM) that establishes joint extension, provides bi-directional resistance prior to a transition point located at 115 degrees and contributes to rapid intertarsal flexion at toe off and full extension prior to touch down. This effect was subsequently quantified by measurement of intertarsal joint moments in prepared anatomical specimens in a neutral horizontal position and axially-loaded vertical position. Correlation with kinematic analyses of walking and running ostriches confirms the contribution of the EDM in vivo. We hypothesise that the passive EDM operates in tandem with a stringently coupled multi-jointed muscle-tendon system to conserve the metabolic cost of locomotion in the ostrich, suggesting that a complete understanding of terrestrial locomotion across extinct and extant taxa must include functional consideration of the ligamentous system.},

@article{Schaller2008,
abstract = {As the fastest long-endurance runner, the bipedal ostrich (Struthio camelus) was selected as a prime model organism to investigate the physical attributes underlying this advanced locomotor performance. A specific integrative approach combining morphological, morphometric, kinematic and pedobarographic methods was developed.  The comparative morphometric analysis of the hind limbs of all ratite species revealed that leg segment ratios in the ostrich are the most specialised for efficient locomotion, especially when taking into consideration its unique supra-jointed toe posture. In addition, the crural muscle mass is more concentrated towards the hip joint in the ostrich than in its ratite relatives. According to the Law of the Pendulum, this concentration of mass towards the pivot point – in concert with the relatively longest and lightest distal leg elements – represents a mechanical optimisation of limb swinging capacities. While musculature clearly drives limb movement, the passive guidance and constraint of motion range by ligamentous structures combined with joint surface contours allows a high level of energy output efficiency during all stages of locomotion and ensures articular stability during slow locomotion as well as high-speed performance. So far, the influence of these passive effects in locomotion has been largely ignored. In order to quantify the guiding effect of these anatomical structures, kinematic data of adult ostriches during walking and running were collected. Subsequently, these data were compared with results from manual manipulation experiments performed with the limbs of anatomical specimens – both fully intact and with muscles removed – leaving only the ligament system intact. This investigation revealed that the range of motion among leg segments was nearly identical in all sample groups, especially in regard to maximum extension values. This indicates that ostrich hind limb dynamics are managed to a significant degree by passive elements that ensure a controlled swing-plane with minimal deviation from an optimal attitude. Further dissections allowed some of these features to be described in detail, with an emphasis on functional-morphological examination of the intertarsal joint. The intertarsal joint contains a significant locking mechanism, briefly mentioned in historical documents, but described and functionally analysed herein for the first time. The functional examination qualified the interplay of three collateral ligaments, the tendinous M. fibularis brevis and specific joint surface protrusions as the basis for this effect which remains absent in smaller ground-dwelling bird species. A proximate quantification, based on comparative morphological and kinematic data, revealed function of Struthio's passively locked intertarsal joint as a potent stabiliser in the supporting limb during the ground-contact phase of locomotion.  During stance phase, it is crucial that the supporting limb is stabilised internally and in relation to the substrate. As yet, no study exists concerning use and loading of the actual ground contact elements. The toes must absorb body mass, guarantee stable grip and provide energetic push off. Obvious specialisations of the ostrich's phalangeal complex include toe reduction (leaving only 3rd and 4th toe), claw reduction (only at 3rd toe) and a permanently elevated metatarsophalangeal joint. Using a relatively new methodology to examine in vivo toe function, pedobarography was employed on specifically trained ostriches to allow extensive collection of Centre of Pressure (CoP) and load distribution (LD) data. In contrast to a relatively predictable CoP trajectory at all speeds, conspicuous LD differences were observed between slow and fast trials. Load was distributed rather inconsistently during walking, while a typical tripod-like toe-print occurred in all running trials to presumably deliver additional stability during the comparatively short stance phase. Significant grip is provided by the highly directed impact of the 3rd toe claw-tip, suggesting its important function as a positional anchor during running. Pedobarographic analysis further showed the importance of the 4th toe as an outrigger to maintain balance, rendering a future reduction highly unlikely.  In conclusion, the application of interdisciplinary methodologies allowed comprehensive data collection and integration of the model organism within its ecological context. The data gained from this thesis increases the current knowledge about ostrich locomotion by identifying distinct structural attributes as essential elements for extreme cursorial performance. The present data may alter existing models for calculation of the metabolic cost of terrestrial locomotion and aid in the reconstruction of theropod locomotion, as these branch sciences often overlook the important role of ligaments and passively-coupled motion cycles in reducing the cost of locomotion.},

abstract = {The spring loaded inverted pendulum template has been shown to accurately model the steady locomotion dynamics of a variety of running animals, and has served as the inspiration for an entire class of dynamic running robots. While the template models the leg dynamics by an energy-conserving spring, insects and animals have structures that dissipate, store and produce energy during a stance phase. Recent investigations into the spring-like properties of limbs, as well as animal response to drop-step perturbations, suggest that animals use their legs to manage energy storage and dissipation, and that this management is important for gait stability. In this paper, we extend our previous analysis of control of the spring loaded inverted pendulum template via changes in the leg touch-down angle to include energy variations during the stance phase. Energy variations are incorporated through leg actuation that varies the force-free leg length during the stance phase, yet maintains qualitatively correct force and velocity profiles. In contrast to the partially asymptotically stable gaits identified in previous analyses, incorporating energy and leg angle variations in this manner produces complete asymptotic stability. Drop-step perturbation simulations reveal that the control strategy is rather robust, with gaits recovering from drops of up to 30{\%} of the nominal hip height.},

abstract = {The adjustment of the leg during running was addressed using a spring-mass model with a fixed landing angle of attack. The objective was to obtain periodic movement patterns. Spring-like running was monitored by a one-dimensional stride-to-stride mapping of the apex height to identify mechanically stable fixed points.We found that for certain angles of attack, the system becomes self-stabilized if the leg stiffness was properly adjusted and a minimum running speed was exceeded. At a given speed, running techniques fulfilling a stable movement pattern are characterized by an almost constant maximum leg force. With increasing speed, the leg adjustment becomes less critical. The techniques predicted for stable running are in agreement with experimental studies.Mechanically self-stabilized running requires a spring-like leg operation, a minimum running speed and a proper adjustment of leg stiffness and angle of attack. These conditions can be considered as a movement criterion for running. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Kinematic and kinetic parameters of running gait were investigated through growth in the ostrich, from two weeks up to 10 months of age, in order to investigate the effects of increasing body size. Ontogenetic scaling relationships were compared with published scaling relationships found to exist with increasing body size between species to determine whether dynamic similarity is maintained during growth. During the study, ostrich mass (M(b)) ranged from 0.7 kg to 108.8 kg. Morphological measurements showed that lengths scaled with positive allometry during growth (hip height proportional to M(b)(0.40); foot segment length proportional to M(b)(0.40); tarsometatarsus length proportional to M(b)(0.41); tibiotarsus length proportional to M(b)(0.38); femur length proportional to M(b)(0.37)), significantly exceeding the close to geometric scaling observed between mammalian and avian species of increasing body size. Scaling of kinematic variables largely agreed with predicted scaling for increasing size and demonstrated relationships close to dynamic similarity and, as such, ontogenetic scaling of locomotor parameters was similar to that observed with increasing body mass between species. However, the ways in which these scaling trends were achieved were very different, with ontogenetic scaling of locomotor mechanics largely resulting from simple scaling of the limb segments rather than postural changes, likely to be due to developmental constraints. Small deviations from dynamic similarity of kinematic parameters and a reduction in the predicted scaling of limb stiffness (proportional to M(b)(0.59)) were found to be accounted for by the positive allometric scaling of the limb during growth.},

abstract = {The functional anatomy of the pelvic limb of the ostrich (Struthio camelus) was investigated in order to assess musculoskeletal specialization related to locomotor performance. The pelvic limbs of ten ostriches were dissected and detailed measurements of all muscle tendon units of the pelvic limb were made, including muscle mass, muscle length, fascicle length, pennation angle, tendon mass and tendon length. From these measurements other muscle properties such as muscle volume, physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), tendon cross-sectional area, maximum isometric muscle force and tendon stress were derived, using standard relationships and published muscle data. Larger muscles tended to be located more proximally and had longer fascicle lengths and lower pennation angles. This led to an expected proximal to distal reduction in total muscle mass. An exception to this trend was the gastrocnemius muscle, which was found to have the largest volume and PCSA and also had the highest capacity for both force and power production. Generally high-power muscles were located more proximally in the limb, while some small distal muscles (tibialis cranialis and flexor perforatus digiti III), with short fibres, were found to have very high force generation capacities. The greatest proportion of pelvic muscle volume was for the hip extensors, while the highest capacity for force generation was observed in the extensors of the ankle, many of which were also in series with long tendons and thus were functionally suited to elastic energy storage.},

Pelvic limbs of six juvenile ostriches were used for this study. The tendon travel technique was used to measure moment arms of 21 muscles at the hip, knee, ankle and metatarsophalangeal joints throughout the ranges of motion observed during level running. Six of the 21 muscles measured were found to have moment arms that did not change with joint angle, whilst the remainder all demonstrated angle-dependent changes for at least one of the joints crossed. Moment arm lengths tended to be longest for the large proximal muscles, whilst the largest relative changes were found for the moment arms of the distal muscles. For muscles where moment arm varied with joint angle: all hip muscles were found to have increasing moment arms with extension of the joint, knee flexors were found to have moment arms that increased with extension, knee extensor moment arms were found to increase with flexion and ankle extensor moment arms increased with extension. The greatest relative changes were observed in the flexors of the metatarsophalangeal joint, for which a three-fold increase in moment arm was observed from flexion to full extension. Changes in muscle moment arm through the range of motion studied appear to optimize muscle function during stance phase, increasing the effective mechanical advantage of these muscles.},

abstract = {In this work we research the role of body dynamics in the complexity of kinematic patterns in a quadruped robot with compliant legs. Two gait patterns, lateral sequence walk and trot, along with leg length control patterns of different complexity were implemented in a modular, feed-forward locomotion controller. The controller was tested on a small, quadruped robot with compliant, segmented leg design, and led to self-stable and self-stabilizing robot locomotion. In-air stepping and on-ground locomotion leg kinematics were recorded, and the number and shapes of motion primitives accounting for 95{\%} of the variance of kinematic leg data were extracted. This revealed that kinematic patterns resulting from feed-forward control had a lower complexity (in-air stepping, 2-3 primitives) than kinematic patterns from on-ground locomotion ($\nu$m4 primitives), although both experiments applied identical motor patterns. The complexity of on-ground kinematic patterns had increased, through ground contact and mechanical entrainment. The complexity of observed kinematic on-ground data matches those reported from level-ground locomotion data of legged animals. Results indicate that a very low complexity of modular, rhythmic, feed-forward motor control is sufficient for level-ground locomotion in combination with passive compliant legged hardware.},

abstract = {Walking and running are two mechanisms for minimizing energy expenditure during terrestrial locomotion. Duty factor, dimensionless speed, existence of an aerial phase, percentage recovery (PR) or phase shift of mechanical energy and shape of the vertical ground reaction force profile have been used to discriminate between walking and running. Although these criteria work well for the classification of most quadrupedal gaits, they result in conflicting evidence for some gaits, such as the t{\"{o}}lt (a symmetrical, four-beat gait used by Icelandic horses). We use established pattern recognition methods to test the hypothesis that the t{\"{o}}lt is a running gait based on an automated and optimized decision drawn from four features (dimensionless speed, duty factor, length of aerial phase and PR for over 6000 strides from four symmetrical gaits in seven Icelandic horses) simultaneously. We compare this decision with the use of each of these features in isolation. Sensitivity and specificity values were used to determine optimal thresholds for classifying t{\"{o}}lt strides based on each feature separately. Duty factor and dimensionless speed indicate that t{\"{o}}lt is more similar to running, while aerial phase and PR indicate that it is more similar to walking. Then, two multidimensional pattern recognition approaches, multivariate Gaussian densities and linear discriminant analysis, were used and it was shown that, in terms of stochastic multidimensional discrimination, t{\"{o}}lt is more similar to 'running'. The approaches presented here have potential to be extended to studies on similar 'ambling' gaits in other quadrupeds.},

abstract = {The present paper describes an implementation of fast running motions involving a humanoid robot. Two important technologies are described: a motion generation and a balance control. The motion generation is a unified way to design both walking and running and can generate the trajectory with the vertical conditions of the Center Of Mass (COM) in short calculation time. The balance control enables a robot to maintain balance by changing the positions of the contact foot dynamically when the robot is disturbed. This control consists of 1) compliance control without force sensors, in which the joints are made compliant by feed-forward torques and adjustment of gains of position control, and 2) feedback control, which uses the measured orientation of the robot's torso used in the motion generation as an initial condition to decide the foot positions. Finally, a human-sized humanoid robot that can run forward at 7.0 [km/h] is presented.},

@article{Taylor1982,
abstract = {This series of four papers investigates the link between the energetics and the mechanics of terrestrial locomotion. Two experimental variables are used throughout the study: speed and body size. Mass-specific metabolic rates of running animals can be varied by about tenfold using either variable. This first paper considers metabolic energy consumed during terrestrial locomotion. New data relating rate of oxygen consumption and speed are reported for: eight species of wild and domestic artiodactyls; seven species of carnivores; four species of primates; and one species of rodent. These are combined with previously published data to formulate a new allometric equation relating mass-specific rates of oxygen consumed (VO2/Mb) during locomotion at a constant speed to speed and body mass (based on data from 62 avian and mammalian species): VO2/Mb = 0.533 Mb-0.316.vg + 0.300 Mb-0.303 where VO2/Mb has the units ml O2 s-1 kg-1; Mb is in kg; and vg is in m s-1. This equation can be expressed in terms of mass-specific rates of energy consumption (Emetab/Mb) using the energetic equivalent of 1 ml O2 = 20.1 J because the contribution of anaerobic glycolysis was negligible: Emetab/Mb = 10.7 Mb-0.316.vg + 6.03 Mb-0.303 where Emetab/Mb has the units watts/kg. This new relationship applies equally well to bipeds and quadrupeds and differs little from the allometric equation reported 12 years ago by Taylor, Schmid-Nielsen {\&} Raab (1970). Ninety per cent of the values calculated from this genera equation for the diverse assortment of avian and mammalian species included in this regression fall within 25{\%} of the observed values at the middle of the speed range where measurements were made. This agreement is impressive when one considers that mass-specific rates of oxygen consumption differed by more than 1400{\%} over this size range of animals.},

@article{Usherwood2012,
abstract = {Bipedal animals experience ground reaction forces (GRFs) that pass close to the centre of mass (CoM) throughout stance, first decelerating the body, then re-accelerating it during the second half of stance. This results in fluctuations in kinetic energy, requiring mechanical work from the muscles. However, here we show analytically that, in extreme cases (with a very large body pitch moment of inertia), continuous alignment of the GRF through the CoM requires greater mechanical work than a maintained vertical force; we show numerically that GRFs passing between CoM and vertical throughout stance are energetically favourable under realistic conditions; and demonstrate that the magnitude, if not the precise form, of actual CoM-torque profiles in running is broadly consistent with simple mechanical work minimization for humans with appropriate pitch moment of inertia. While the potential energetic savings of CoM-torque support strategies are small (a few per cent) over the range of human running, their importance increases dramatically at high speeds and stance angles. Fast, compliant runners or hoppers would benefit considerably from GRFs more vertical than the zero-CoM-torque strategy, especially with bodies of high pitch moment of inertia—suggesting a novel advantage to kangaroos of their peculiar long-head/long-tail structure.},

@article{Vejdani2013,
abstract = {We proposed three swing leg control policies for spring-mass running robots, inspired by experimental data from our recent collaborative work on ground running birds. Previous investigations suggest that animals may prioritize injury avoidance and/or efficiency as their objective function during running rather than maintaining limit-cycle stability. Therefore, in this study we targeted structural capacity (maximum leg force to avoid damage) and efficiency as the main goals for our control policies, since these objective functions are crucial to reduce motor size and structure weight. Each proposed policy controls the leg angle as a function of time during flight phase such that its objective function during the subsequent stance phase is regulated. The three objective functions that are regulated in the control policies are (i) the leg peak force, (ii) the axial impulse, and (iii) the leg actuator work. It should be noted that each control policy regulates one single objective function. Surprisingly, all three swing leg control policies result in nearly identical subsequent stance phase dynamics. This implies that the implementation of any of the proposed control policies would satisfy both goals (damage avoidance and efficiency) at once. Furthermore, all three control policies require a surprisingly simple leg angle adjustment: leg retraction with constant angular acceleration.},

abstract = {A staining procedure used for simultaneously determining three different fibre types in single sections bovine, porcine or ovine skeletal muscle was modified for use with ostrich skeletal muscle. The muscle fibres of gastrocnemius pars externa, tibialis cranialis caput tibiale, tibialis cranialis caput femorale and fibularis longus tendo caudalis were studied. The histochemical results revealed the presence of three types of fibre only in the gastrocnemius pars externa muscle: fast-twitch glycolytic fibres (FG), fast-twitch oxidative glycolytic fibres (FOG) and slow-twitch oxidative fibres (SO), while in the other muscles the FG fibres were absent. The percentage distribution of fibres types showed a higher incidence of SO fibres compared to FOG fibres in tibialis cranialis caput femorale and tibialis cranialis caput tibiale muscles, while it was opposite in the case of the fibularis longus tendo caudalis muscle. In the gastrocnemius pars externa muscle the FG fibres outnumber the other fibres, followed by the SO and FOG fibres. The results of the analysis of variance show significant interaction between muscle x fibre type for every morphometric parameter evaluated. Differences about value of fibres area exists between tibialis cranialis caput femorale and fibularis longus tendo caudalis muscles. Both fibre types in tibialis cranialis caput tibiale muscle have mean values of transversal section area smaller than tibialis cranialis caput femorale. The other morphometric parameters show a similar trend. The gastrocnemius pars externa muscle presents similar dimensions of muscle fibres for the FG and FOG types, and significantly smaller for the SO type.},

A many degree of freedom sys- tem is transformed into the problem with reduced number of degrees by application of nonlinear normal modes. The modes are formulated with respect to the system's vibration amplitude on the basis of free vibrations of a nonlinear con- servative system and then applied to systems with force o parametric excitations. The analysis shows effectiveness of the method for three examples: classical viscous damped os- cillator and for self-excited models with parametric and ex- ternal excitations.

@article{Watson2011,
abstract = {A widely held assumption is that metabolic rate (Ė(met)) during legged locomotion is linked to the mechanics of different gaits and this linkage helps explain the preferred speeds of animals in nature. However, despite several prominent exceptions, Ė(met) of walking and running vertebrates has been nearly uniformly characterized as increasing linearly with speed across all gaits. This description of locomotor energetics does not predict energetically optimal speeds for minimal cost of transport (E(cot)). We tested whether large bipedal ratite birds (emus and ostriches) have gait-specific energetics during walking and running similar to those found in humans. We found that during locomotion, emus showed a curvilinear relationship between Ė(met) and speed during walking, and both emus and ostriches demonstrated an abrupt change in the slope of Ė(met) versus speed at the gait transition with a linear increase during running. Similar to human locomotion, the minimum net E(cot) calculated after subtracting resting metabolism was lower in walking than in running in both species. However, the difference in net E(cot) between walking and running was less than is found in humans because of a greater change in the slope of Ė(met) versus speed at the gait transition, which lowers the cost of running for the avian bipeds. For emus, we also show that animals moving freely overground avoid a range of speeds surrounding the gait-transition speed within which the E(cot) is large. These data suggest that deviations from a linear relation of metabolic rate and speed and variations in transport costs with speed are more widespread than is often assumed, and provide new evidence that locomotor energetics influences the choice of speed in bipedal animals. The low cost of transport for walking is probably ecologically important for emus and ostriches because they spend the majority of their active day walking, and thus the energy used for locomotion is a large part of their daily energy budget.},

@article{Weems2006,
abstract = {Twenty trackways of Kayentapus minor were exposed on a single bedding plane at the Culpeper Crushed Stone Quarry (Stevensburg, Virginia) in the early 1990's. These trackways included over 1800 footprints. Empirical analysis of this large population of dinosaur footprints and related stride lengths provides the first reliable estimates of gait parameters for a medium-sized theropod dinosaur. Walking animals made most of the trackways, but four trackways show bursts of jogging or running behavior. In one instance, a trackmaker burst from a walk to a full run in a span of three paces. The trackways are so extensive that the range and modes of walking, jogging and running stride lengths can be accurately determined for this trackmaker. Knowledge of the points at which jogging and running should begin allows an estimation of jogging and running speeds independent of Alexander's Formula, which is usually used for estimating dinosaur speeds. This alternative method of determining speed allows a more precise determination of the constant and exponent powers appropriate for Alexander's Formula when it is applied to non-maniraptoriform theropod dinosaurs, thus improving the accuracy of that formula for estimating the speeds of this subset of theropods.

Physiol. 49, 208-215; Graham-Brown (1922) The physiology of stepping, J. Neur. Psychopathol. 3, 112-116. Only in recent years, however, have the mechanisms been analyzed in detail. Quite a few of these mechanisms have been described using the decerebrate cat. Locomotion is initiated in decerebrate cats by activation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that activates the medial medullary reticular formation (MRF) which in turn projects axons to the spinal cord which descend within the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF). The MRF region regulates as well as initiates the stepping pattern and is thought to be involved in interlimb coordination. Afferent feedback from proprioceptors and exteroceptors can modify the ongoing locomotor pattern. Recently, the types of afferents responsible for signaling the stance to swing transition have been identified. A general rule states that if the limb is unloaded and the leg is extended, then swing will occur. The afferents that detect unloading of the limb are the Golgi tendon organs and stimulation of these afferents (at group I strengths) prolongs the stance phase in walking cats. The afferents that detect the extension of the leg have been found to be the length- and velocity-sensitive muscle afferents located in flexor muscles. Plasticity of locomotor systems is discussed briefly in this article. Decerebrate animals can adapt locomotor behaviors to respond to new environmental conditions. Oligosynaptic reflex pathways that control locomotion can be recalibrated after injury in a manner that appears to be functionally related to the recovery of the animal.},

Based on the typical robots investigated, the trade-off between each category is summarized. In addition, the most significant performances of these robots are compared quantitatively, and multiple available solutions for the future compliant legged robot design are suggested. Finally, the design challenges for compliant legged robots are analysed. This review will provide useful guidance for robotic designers in creating new designs by inheriting the virtues of those successful robots according to the specific tasks.},
